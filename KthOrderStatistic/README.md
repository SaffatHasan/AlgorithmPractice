The goal of this repository is to become familiar with
- golang
- golang project structures
- heap data structures (in golang)


## Structure
- `main.go` the entrypoint for the project. Contains a simple "hello world"
- `pkg/`
  - `algorithms/`
    - `kth_order_statistic.go` contains the KthOrderStatistic(arr []int, k int) implementation
  - `datastructures/`
    - `max_heap.go` contains the MaxHeap implementation for integers
